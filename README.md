## Reflection

I wanted to build a component with Vue. I choose the United States Senate as a subject. Unfortunately, there was no API that magically offered the information I wanted to display. I needed to gather it myself. This required time as there are 100 Senators.

I wanted to let users view Senators by the states they represent, their political parties, classes (when up for re-election), and leadership roles they hold (if any). The lists were long. I installed anchor links and a fixed menu so users can jump between sub-categories on a page. I also built show/hide elements so users can view supporting material about the Senate and states.

I also wanted users to be able to click on the photo of a Senator and go to a page with detailed information about him or her. This was challenging. I wanted the destination pages to have dedicated URLs that users could share. I wanted users to land at the top of the destination page, but also go back to where they were before if they clicked or tapped the browser's "back" button. I used "children" routes, the "scrollTo" method, and the browserâ€™s native functionality to accomplish these things.

Lastly, I spent time exploring colors to try to get a design that looks a combination of respectable and engaging. Adobe Color was a big help here.
